#DISCLAIMER: this is experimental work to showcase how to extend the OpenShift Console with Dynamic Plugins (See below for details).

# ACS Plugin
This first plugin located in src/components/ACSView.tsx shows mocked data (coming from ACS: Red Hat Advanced Cluster security for Kubernetes) into a custom view within the OpenShift console. Here a preview of what this looks like:

# OpenShift Console Plugin Template

This project is a minimal template for writing a new OpenShift Console dynamic
plugin. It requires OpenShift 4.10.

[Dynamic plugins](https://github.com/openshift/console/tree/master/frontend/packages/console-dynamic-plugin-sdk)
allow you to extend the
[OpenShift UI](https://github.com/openshift/console)
at runtime, adding custom pages and other extensions. They are based on
[webpack module federation](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/).
Plugins are registered with console using the `ConsolePlugin` custom resource
and enabled in the console operator config by a cluster administrator.

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) are required
to build and run the example. To run OpenShift console in a container, either
[Docker](https://www.docker.com) or [podman 3.2.0+](https://podman.io) and
[oc](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads) are required.

## Getting started

After cloning this repo, you should update the plugin metadata such as the
plugin name in the `consolePlugin` declaration of [package.json](package.json).

```json
"consolePlugin": {
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "displayName": "My Plugin",
  "description": "Enjoy this shiny, new console plugin!",
  "exposedModules": {
    "ExamplePage": "./components/ExamplePage"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@console/pluginAPI": "*"
  }
}
```

The template adds a single example page in the Home navigation section. The
extension is declared in the [console-extensions.json](console-extensions.json)
file and the React component is declared in
[src/components/ExamplePage.tsx](src/components/ExamplePage.tsx).

You can run the plugin using a local development environment or build an image
to deploy it to a cluster.

## Development

### Option 1: Local

In one terminal window, run:

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn run start`

In another terminal window, run:

1. `oc login` (requires [oc](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads) and an [OpenShift cluster](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create))
2. `yarn run start-console` (requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com) or [podman 3.2.0+](https://podman.io))

This will run the OpenShift console in a container connected to the cluster
you've logged into. The plugin HTTP server runs on port 9001 with CORS enabled.
Navigate to <http://localhost:9000/example> to see the running plugin.

#### Running start-console with Apple silicon and podman

If you are using podman on a Mac with Apple silicon, `yarn run start-console`
might fail since it runs an amd64 image. You can workaround the problem with
[qemu-user-static](https://github.com/multiarch/qemu-user-static) by running
these commands:

```bash
podman machine ssh
sudo -i
rpm-ostree install qemu-user-static
systemctl reboot
```

### Option 2: Docker + VSCode Remote Container

Make sure the
[Remote Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
extension is installed. This method uses Docker Compose where one container is
the OpenShift console and the second container is the plugin. It requires that
you have access to an existing OpenShift cluster. After the initial build, the
cached containers will help you start developing in seconds.

1. Create a `dev.env` file inside the `.devcontainer` folder with the correct values for your cluster:

```bash
OC_PLUGIN_NAME=my-plugin
OC_URL=https://api.example.com:6443
OC_USER=kubeadmin
OC_PASS=<password>
```

2. `(Ctrl+Shift+P) => Remote Containers: Open Folder in Container...`
3. `yarn run start`
4. Navigate to <http://localhost:9000/example>

## Docker image

Before you can deploy your plugin on a cluster, you must build an image and
push it to an image registry.

1. Build the image:
   ```sh
   docker build -t quay.io/my-repositroy/my-plugin:latest .
   ```
2. Run the image:
   ```sh
   docker run -it --rm -d -p 9001:80 quay.io/my-repository/my-plugin:latest
   ```
3. Push the image:
   ```sh
   docker push quay.io/my-repository/my-plugin:latest
   ```

NOTE: If you have a Mac with Apple silicon, you will need to add the flag
`--platform=linux/amd64` when building the image to target the correct platform
to run in-cluster.

## Deployment on cluster

After pushing an image with your changes to a registry, you can deploy the
plugin to a cluster by instantiating the provided
[OpenShift template](template.yaml). It will run a light-weight nginx HTTP
server to serve your plugin's assets.

```sh
oc process -f template.yaml \
  -p PLUGIN_NAME=my-plugin \
  -p NAMESPACE=my-plugin-namespace \
  -p IMAGE=quay.io/my-repository/my-plugin:latest \
  | oc create -f -
```

`PLUGIN_NAME` must match the plugin name you used in the `consolePlugin`
declaration of [package.json](package.json).

Once deployed, patch the
[Console operator](https://github.com/openshift/console-operator)
config to enable the plugin.

```sh
oc patch consoles.operator.openshift.io cluster \
  --patch '{ "spec": { "plugins": ["my-plugin"] } }' --type=merge
```
